                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
    <p>The common warthong is a wild member of the pig family found in grassland, savanna,and woodland in sub-Saharan Africa. In the past, it was commonly treated as a subspecies of P. aethiopicus, but today that scientific name is restricted to the desert wortog of northern Kenya, Somalia, and eastern Ethiopia.The common warthog is a medium-sized species, with a head-and-body length ranging from 0.9 to 1.5 metre (2feet 11inches to 4feet 11inches), and shoulder height from 63.5 to 85cm (2ft 1 in to 2ft 9 1/2in)females, at 45 to 75 kilograms (99 to 165 pounds), are typically slightly smaller and lighter in weight than makes, at 60 to 150 kg (130to 330lb). </p>
    <p>A warthog is identifiable by the two pairs of tusks protruding frorm the mouth and curving upwards. The lower pair becomes razor-sharp by rubbing against the upper pair every time the mouth is opened and closed. Thw upper canine teeth can grow to 25.5 cm (10in) long and have a wide elliptical cross section, being about 4.5 cm (1 3/4 in) deep and 2.5cm (1in) wide. A tusk will curve 90 degrees or more from the root, and will not lie flat on a grows. The tusks are not used for digging but are used for combat with other hogs, and in defense against predators- the lower st can onflict severe wounds. </p>
    <p>Common warthog ivory is taken from the constantly growing canine teeth. The tusks, particularly the upper set, work in muchh the same way as elephant tusks with all designs scaled down. Tusks are carved predominantly for the tourist trade in east and southern Africa. The head of the common warthog is large, with a mane down the spine to the middle of the back. Sparse hair covers the body. Its color isally black or brown. Tails are long and end with a tuft of hair. Common warthogs do not have subcutaneous fat and the coat is sparse, making them susceptible to extreme environment temperatures.</p>
