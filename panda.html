                    <h3>PANDAS</h3>
    <p>The giant panda also known as the panda bear or simply the panda is a bear native  to South Central China. It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is somtimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore,with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.</p>
    <p>Giant panda in the wild will occasionally eat ther grassses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bannas along with specially repared food.  The giant panda lives in a few mountain range in central China,  mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi ND Gansu. As a result of frming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lawland areas where it once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species.</p>
    <p>A 2007 report showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country. As of December 2014,49 giant panda lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 different countries. Wild population estimates vary; one estimate shows tha there are about 1,590 inividuals living inthe wild, whileva 2006 study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000.</p>
