                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
     <p>The giraffe is an African artiodactylmammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. It is traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffe camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. However, the existence of up to eight extant giraffe species has been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA,as well as morphological measurements of Giraffe. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species known from fossils.</p>
    <p>The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classfied under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somaliain the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlnds. Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.</p>
    <p>The giraffe has intrigued various cultures, both ancient and modern, for its peculiar appearance,and has often been featured in paintings, books,and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as vulnerable to extinction, and has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. Giraffe are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves but estimates as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately 9,500 members of giraffa  in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.</p>
