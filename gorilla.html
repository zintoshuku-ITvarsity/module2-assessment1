                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
     <p>The eastern gorilla has become increasingly endangered since the 1990s, and the species ws listed as critically endangered in September 2016 as its population continued to decrease.Prmary threats to the eastern gorilla include habitat destruction for residential, commercial, and agricultural puproses, habital fragmentation caused by transportation corridoes and resource extraction, as ell as disease. Betwen 1996 and 2016, the eastern gorilla lost more than 70 percent of its population, and by 2016 the total population was estimated to be less than 6000. An exception to this declining trend is the mountain gorilla. According to the most recent estimates, ther are approximately1004 mountain gorilla,and their numbers continue to grow.</p>
    <p>In some national parks,viewing mountan gorillas is a populartourist attraction. These national parks iclude Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda,Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Mgahinga Gorilla National Prk and Bwindi Impenetrable National Park un Unganda. While ecotourism can benefit gorilla populations by generating revenue for conservation efforts, there is concern that increased exposure to humans will place gorilla at greater risk of contracting zoonotic diseases.</p>
    <p>Studies have shown that habituated eastern gorillas, that is, those that leave protected areas to forage in surrounding communities, have higher diseases rates than their unhabituated counterparts, with nearby humans and livestock as the likely sources of transmission.</p>
