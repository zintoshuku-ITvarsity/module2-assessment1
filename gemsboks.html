                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
    <p>The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx (oryx gazella ) is a large antelope in the genus oryx. It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such as the kalahari desert. some authorities formerly included the East African oryx as a subspecies. The gemsbok is depicted on the coat arms of Namibiaa, where the current population of the species is estimated at 373,000 individuals.</p>
    <p>Oryx is a genus consisting of four large antelope species called oryxes. Three of them are native to arid parts of Africa, and the fourth to the Arabian Peninsula. Their fur is pale with contrasting dark marking in the face and on the legs, and  their long horns are almost straight. The exception is the scimiter oryx, which lacks dark markings on the legs only has faint dark marking on the head, has an ochre neck, and horns that are clearly decutved.</p>
    <p>The Arabian oryx was only saved from extinction through a captive breeding program and reintroduction to the wild. The scimitar oryx, which is now listed as extinct in the wild, also relies on a captive breeding program for its survival.</p>
